## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-assistant-bot.git
   cd hotel-assistant-bot
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

To train the Rasa model with your current data, run:

```sh
make train
```

This command will train the Rasa model using the domain, data, and configuration files, and save the trained model in the `models` directory.

### Running the Action Server

To start the action server, which handles custom actions, run:

```sh
make run-actions
```

### Interacting with the Bot

You can interact with the bot using Rasa Shell:

```sh
make shell
```

This will start the action server and open the Rasa shell, allowing you to chat with the bot in the terminal.

Alternatively, you can run the bot and interact with it via HTTP API:

```sh
make run
```

Once the server is running, you can interact with the bot using either of the following web applications:

- **[chatbot-html-js-css-web-app](./chatbot-html-js-css-web-app)**: Basic interface for chatting with the bot using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
  - **Directory**: [Chatbot HTML + JS + CSS](https://github.com/JiteshGaikwad/Chatbot-Widget/tree/main)
- **[chatbot-react-vite-web-app](./chatbot-react-vite-web-app)**: Modern and dynamic web application using React + Vite.
  - **Directory**: [React Chat Widget](https://github.com/Wolox/react-chat-widget/tree/master)

To run the React application, navigate to its directory and execute `npm run dev`.

### Using Rasa X

To use Rasa X for managing and improving your bot, run:

```sh
make run-x
```

Open Rasa X in your web browser at `http://localhost:5002`. Rasa X provides an interface for chatting with your bot, reviewing conversations, annotating data, and retraining models.

## Configuration

- **Domain File:** `configs/domain.yml` contains the intents, entities, slots, responses, and forms used by the bot.
- **Training Data:** `data` directory contains the NLU and Core training data.
- **Config File:** `configs/config.yml` specifies the pipeline and policies for training the model.
- **Endpoints File:** `configs/endpoints.yml` defines the endpoints for the action server and other external services.
